# DebiasingConGater

This repository is dedicated to the models available in the EACL2024 submission.

The infrastructure of the code is similar to the [ModularizedDebiasing](https://github.com/CPJKU/ModularizedDebiasing) from the papers:

[Modular and On-demand Bias Mitigation with Attribute-Removal Subnetworks](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.386.pdf)

and 

[Parameter-efficient Modularised Bias Mitigation via AdapterFusion](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.201.pdf)
